Welcome to the "Complete Python with DSA Bootcamp"! This comprehensive course is designed to take you from a beginner to a confident programmer, mastering both Python and essential data structures and algorithms (DSA) needed for technical interviews and real-world applications.

### What You Will Learn

In this bootcamp, you will start with the fundamentals of Python programming. You will become familiar with Python syntax, data types, control structures, and functions. As you progress, you will dive into more advanced topics, including object-oriented programming and error handling, ensuring you have a solid foundation before moving on to data structures.

Next, we will explore various data structures in detail. You will learn about arrays, lists, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs. For each data structure, you will understand its use cases, advantages, and limitations. You will also implement these structures from scratch, reinforcing your understanding through practical exercises.

Algorithms are the backbone of problem-solving in programming. This course covers essential algorithms, including sorting (quick sort, merge sort) and searching (binary search), as well as more advanced topics like recursion and dynamic programming. You will learn to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms, helping you to choose the most efficient solution for any problem.

### Hands-On Projects and Coding Challenges

Throughout the course, you will engage in hands-on projects and coding challenges that simulate real-world scenarios. Each section includes practical exercises to reinforce your learning, and you will work on projects that consolidate your understanding of Python and DSA. By the end of the course, you will have a portfolio of projects to showcase your skills to potential employers.

### Who This Course Is For
